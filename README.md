Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.


Clone the Repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository-name.git
```

Navigate into the project directory:

```
cd your-repository-name
```


Install Dependencies
Install the required dependencies using npm or Yarn:

```
npm install
```
or
```
yarn install
```


Set Up JSON Server
Install JSON Server globally if you havenâ€™t already:

```
npm install -g json-server
```
or

```
yarn global add json-server
```
Create a db.json file in the root directory of your project with the following content:

```
{
  "person": [
    {
      "id": "1",
      "Name": "John",
      "Surname": "Doe",
      "UserType": "Admin",
      "CreatedDate": "2024-01-01",
      "City": "New York",
      "Address": "123 Main St"
    },
    {
      "id": "2",
      "Name": "Jane",
      "Surname": "Doe",
      "UserType": "User",
      "CreatedDate": "2024-01-02",
      "City": "Los Angeles",
      "Address": "456 Elm St"
    }
  ]
}
```


Start JSON Server
Run the JSON Server to serve the mock API:

```
json-server --watch db.json --port 3000
```
This command will start the JSON Server on port 3000.


Start the React Application
In a separate terminal window, start the React application:

```
npm start
```
or
```
yarn start
```
